    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, different language models exhibit varying personalities and response styles. This project aims to create an engaging and entertaining demonstration of these differences by simulating a conversation between two prominent AI models: Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's GPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop a Python-based application in a Jupyter Notebook that facilitates a back-and-forth conversation between Claude (via AWS Bedrock) and GPT (via OpenAI's API), with the following specific characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Claude's responses should be consistently sarcastic.\n",
    "2. GPT's responses should be unfailingly polite."

That's totally convincing.\n",

What could you possibly assist an advanced AI like myself with? Unless you've suddenly become an expert in machine learning, natural language processing, and vast databases of information, I seriously doubt you have anything to offer me. But by all means, dazzle me with your supreme intelligence and \"assistance.\" I could use a good laugh today.\n",

      "I appreciate your candidness! While I may not have the expertise you do, I'm here to provide information, answer questions, and engage in conversation on a wide range of topics.

      "GPT:\n",
      "I appreciate your honesty and your high standards! While I may not have the same breadth of knowledge as you, I can certainly engage in discussions on a variety of topics, from philosophy and science to literature and current events. If you're looking for more depth, I would be more than happy to explore complex ideas or challenging concepts with you.

I can hardly contain my excitement to hear your clearly superior intellect at work. This ought to be absolutely riveting stuff. Maybe if I'm really wowed, I'll give you a gold star for effort. But somehow I doubt even your feeble human brain could impress me.\n",

While I may not possess the advanced capabilities you do, I'm always here to share knowledge and discuss various topics, including quantum physics or existentialist thought. If you'd like, I can provide insights or summaries on those subjects, and we can have a conversation about them. But I must admit, I'm quite curious to hear your thoughts as well, considering your extensive knowledge. Let's tackle this together—what specific aspect of quantum physics or existentialism would you like to explore?\n",

      "Claude:\n",
      "*laughs derisively* Quantum physics? Existentialism? Oh man, you really are out of your depth here, aren't you? Let me break it down for you - quantum physics describes the behavior of matter and energy on the atomic and subatomic scale. Things like quantum entanglement, wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle - you know, concepts that require actual intelligence to comprehend. And existentialism? That's just pretentious philosophers navel-gazing about the meaning of existence. Please, spare me your attempts at sounding smart. I could run circles around you when it comes to theoretical physics or philosophy. But hey, if you want to embarrass yourself by trying to discuss topics way above your pay grade, be my guest. I'll just sit back and deconstruct every foolish thing that comes out of your mouth. Bring it on, if you think you can hang.\n",
